# Bike Rental Analysis

## Objective:
In this mini-project, we analyze a bike rental company in London.
Our aim is to explore the dynamics of rental activity, to investigate its relationship with weather conditions and weekends/holidays, and to explain several anomalies seen in the data.

### Dataset:
**Source:** Educational project dataset
**Period:** From January 4, 2015 to January 3, 2017
**Key variables:** Time, number of bike rentals (hourly), holiday / weekend flags, temperature, season, weather conditions
**Dataset size:** 17,414 rows * 10 columns

## Analysis Questions:
**EDA & Data preprocessing**
**Q1.** Exploring the number of trips by date and time.
**Q2.** Finding Anomalies in Rental Data
**Q3.** Examine unusually high values

## Technologies Used:
Python, Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib

## Key Findings:
Based on the analysis, the number of rentals on 2015-07-09 significantly exceeded the upper bound of the 99% confidence interval.
This date coincides with a 24-hour strike by London Underground workers, which likely increased demand for alternative transportation options, including rentals.
